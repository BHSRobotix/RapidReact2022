This repository contains all of our code for the Rapid React 2022 FRC game. We are a First Robotics Competition located in Burlington, Massachusetts. 

### Who Are We?

### In the Community
Team 2876 is active outside of FRC competitions. Since 2011, our team has been mentoring students in after school and summer programs in all four elementary schools in our town of Burlington, MA. As of 2016, we also started multiple FLL (First LEGO League) teams in Burlingtonâ€™s Marshall Simonds Middle School. We are also active participants in local events, such as Burlington Pride Day and the 4th of July Parade.

### What is FIRST?
FIRST stands for *For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology*. Founded by Dean Kamen in 1989, FIRST has, over the past 20+ years, generated interest in the science and technology fields in many students through its various programs, including FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition), FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge), and FLL (FIRST LEGO League).
